# Weather-Dashboard

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly tool for checking the weather in various cities. The weather dashboard will have a simple input form where users can type in the name of a city. Once a city is entered, users will be provided with information on current weather conditions and a forecast for the future. Also, the dashboard will keep a record of users' past searches.
